## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: N-ary comparison operators

The comparison operators `=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` SHALL accept any number of
arguments as chained (pairwise) comparisons: for operands `a b c …` the result is the
conjunction `(op a b) ∧ (op b c) ∧ …`, short-circuiting to `#f` on the first false pair.
Each operand SHALL be evaluated exactly once, left to right. A comparison of fewer than
two arguments (`(op)` or `(op a)`) SHALL evaluate to `#t`. The operators `>`, `<=`, and
`>=` SHALL be derived in the frontend from the existing `<` and `=` primitives
(`(> x y)` = `(< y x)`, `(<= x y)` = `(or (< x y) (= x y))`,
`(>= x y)` = `(or (< y x) (= x y))`). This SHALL be a frontend expansion into `<` / `=`
primitive calls and `if`/`let` core forms, with no change to the runtime or the emitted
calling convention.

#### Scenario: Chained less-than and equality

- **WHEN** a program evaluates `(< 1 2 3)`, `(< 1 3 2)`, and `(= 4 4 4)`
- **THEN** the results are `#t`, `#f`, and `#t`

#### Scenario: Derived greater-than and inclusive comparisons

- **WHEN** a program evaluates `(> 3 2 1)`, `(<= 1 1 2)`, and `(>= 3 3 2)`
- **THEN** the results are `#t`, `#t`, and `#t`

#### Scenario: Single evaluation of operands

- **WHEN** a program uses a middle operand with a side effect in an n-ary comparison,
  such as `(< 0 (begin (set! calls (+ calls 1)) 5) 10)` where `calls` starts at `0`
- **THEN** the comparison is `#t` and the operand runs exactly once (`calls` ends at `1`),
  even though the middle operand participates in two adjacent pairwise tests

#### Scenario: Trivial arity

- **WHEN** a program evaluates `(< 5)` and `(=)`
- **THEN** both results are `#t`
