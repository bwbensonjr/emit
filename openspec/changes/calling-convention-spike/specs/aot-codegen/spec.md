## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Calling-convention decision for variadic application is evidence-backed and recorded

The project SHALL record a decision on the calling convention used for Scheme functions —
how dotted rest parameters, variadic `lambda`, and `apply` over arbitrary-length lists are
supported while preserving guaranteed tail calls (`musttail`) under a single uniform
function prototype — supported by a direct comparison of candidate conventions that emit
and run real LLVM IR, together with the rationale and the scoring that produced it.

#### Scenario: Candidate conventions are exercised in real IR

- **WHEN** the calling-convention decision is made
- **THEN** at least the leading candidate conventions have been implemented as throwaway
  LLVM IR experiments that compile and run
- **AND** each is shown to express a dotted-rest function and an `apply` over a
  runtime-built list longer than the fixed-argument width
- **AND** each is shown either to preserve `musttail` on a tail-recursive loop (running in
  bounded stack) or to be eliminated for failing to

#### Scenario: Decision is recorded with rationale

- **WHEN** the comparison is complete
- **THEN** the chosen convention, the scoring (correctness, `musttail` preserved,
  hot-loop overhead vs. the current fixed-arity baseline, emission complexity), and the
  rationale are recorded in this change's design doc
- **AND** `LLVM.md`'s "Calling convention" and "Tail calls" sections are updated to be
  consistent with the recorded decision
