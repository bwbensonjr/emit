# core-language Specification

## Purpose

Defines the M1 core-lambda subset of Scheme that the compiler accepts and the runtime
guarantees for programs written in it: the supported data types, special forms, and
primitives, and the requirement that tail calls execute in bounded stack space.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Compile and run the M1 core-lambda subset

The compiler SHALL accept a single top-level expression over the M1 core subset —
fixnums, booleans, the empty list, and pairs; the forms `quote`, `if`, `lambda`,
application, `let`, `letrec`, `begin`, and `set!`; and the primitives `+ - * = <`,
`cons`, `car`, `cdr`, `null?`, `pair?`, `eq?` — and compile it to a native executable
that computes the expression's value.

#### Scenario: Recursive arithmetic

- **WHEN** a tail-recursive `fact`-style program over fixnums, `if`, `letrec`, and
  arithmetic primitives is compiled and run
- **THEN** the executable produces the mathematically correct result

#### Scenario: Allocation and pairs

- **WHEN** a program builds and traverses a list via `cons`, `car`, `cdr`, and `null?`
- **THEN** the executable produces the correct result, with pairs heap-allocated under
  Boehm GC

#### Scenario: Assignment

- **WHEN** a program uses `set!` on a captured variable (exercising assignment
  conversion)
- **THEN** the executable produces the correct result and no `set!` survives into the
  emitted IR

### Requirement: Proper tail calls run in bounded stack

Calls in tail position SHALL be compiled as guaranteed tail calls (`musttail`), so that
tail-recursive loops execute in constant stack space.

#### Scenario: Deep tail loop does not overflow

- **WHEN** a tail-recursive loop iterating a large number of times (beyond the native
  stack depth) is compiled and run
- **THEN** the executable completes and returns the correct result without stack overflow
